# Quantitative Research & System Design

Building probabilistic decision systems for uncertain markets.

---

## Focus

Quantitative Strategy Development  
Market Structure & Liquidity Modeling  
Regime Detection & Risk Asymmetry  
Backtesting & Walk-Forward Validation  
Machine Learning for Financial Signals  

---

## Research Approach

All models must:

• Survive out-of-sample testing  
• Remain robust across volatility regimes  
• Maintain positive expectancy under realistic costs  
• Prioritize risk control over return optics  

Edge is engineered through structure, not prediction.
